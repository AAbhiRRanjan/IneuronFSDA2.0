    "Both def statements and lambda expressions are used to define functions in Python, but they have some differences in their syntax and behavior.\n",

    "The def statement is used to define a function using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_name(arguments): # function body return value Here, function_name is the name of the function, arguments is the list of arguments that the function takes, and value is the value that the function returns. The function body is indented and contains the statements that define the function's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a lambda expression is a way of defining a function using a single expression, with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression Here, arguments is the list of arguments that the function takes, and expression is a single expression that the function evaluates and returns. lambda expressions can be used in place of def statements when a small, anonymous function is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference between def statements and lambda expressions is that def statements can define functions of any size and complexity, with multiple statements and control structures, while lambda expressions are limited to a single expression. Additionally, def statements create named functions that can be used throughout a program, while lambda expressions create anonymous functions that are typically used as throwaway functions, such as in a sorting key or a mapping function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both def statements and lambda expressions are used to define functions in Python, but def statements are more general and can define functions of any size and complexity, while lambda expressions are limited to single expressions and are typically used for simple, anonymous functions."

    "The primary benefit of using lambda expressions in Python is their conciseness and flexibility. Lambda expressions allow you to define small, anonymous functions \"on the fly\" without the need to define a named function using a def statement. This can be useful in situations where you need to pass a function as an argument to another function or method, such as in the map(), filter(), and sort() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions can also be used to create specialized functions quickly and easily, such as sorting a list of complex objects based on a particular attribute. For example, to sort a list of dictionaries by their \"name\" key, you could use the following lambda expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "sorted_list = sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda d: d['name']) This creates an anonymous function that takes a dictionary d and returns the value of its \"name\" key.

    "map() - map() applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns a new iterable with the results.

    "1.Keep functions short and focused: Functions should be designed to perform a single, well-defined task. Avoid creating functions that are too long or try to accomplish too many things.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Use descriptive names: Choose descriptive names for your functions that accurately reflect their purpose and what they do.\n",

    "3.Follow a consistent naming convention: Be consistent with naming conventions used throughout your codebase. This makes it easier to read and understand the code.\n",

    "5.Minimize side effects: Functions should not have unexpected side effects that can affect other parts of your code. Make sure your function only modifies the data it is supposed to and doesn't affect other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Keep error handling in mind: Design functions with error handling in mind. Functions should gracefully handle errors and return meaningful error messages to the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Write clear and concise documentation: Document your functions clearly and concisely, including information on their inputs, outputs, and behavior. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use your code.\n",

    "8.Test your functions: Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they work correctly and behave as expected in different scenarios."
